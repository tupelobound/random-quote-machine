freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries project - Build a Random Quote Generator

This project was originally part of the Intermediate Front End Development certificate, later updated to Front End Development Libraries.

Main focus of certificate is interacting with APIs and using libraries such as JQuery and React.

This project brief was to fulfill the following user stories:

1.  I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".
2.  Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".
3.  Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".
4.  Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".
5.  Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".
6.  On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".
7.  On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
8.  When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.
9.  My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.
11. The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

Originally completed in January 2018.
